### About
Final year B.Tech student at VIT Vellore with two internships in the software industry. Working on Android development with Flutter and backend development with Flask. Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. Ranked in the top 31% on LeetCode. AWS SAA Certified and OCI GenAI Certified, with expertise in generative AI and machine learning techniques. Seeking a role to leverage my skills in impactful projects.

### Experience
**Software Engineering Intern ‚Äì Mukesoft (06/2024 - 08/2024)**
- Developed AI algorithms for online exam proctoring, ensuring exam integrity by monitoring candidates and detecting multiple individuals using Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.
- Utilized machine learning fundamentals and deep learning techniques, including the Haarcascade algorithm for facial recognition and advanced eye movement tracking, to achieve precise detection and recognition, significantly enhancing exam security and improving system reliability.
- Implemented a feature to detect and record voice chats during the exam. Utilized speech-to-text conversion to transcribe conversations, enhancing the ability to identify and address potential cheating by capturing and analyzing any chat activity.

**Teaching Assistant Intern ‚Äì Coding Ninjas (11/2023-02/2024)**
- Achieved a 4.85/5 rating by effectively tackling over 300 coding challenges and providing dedicated support, leveraging strong skills in Data Structures and Algorithms.
- Refined debugging and communication skills to help students grasp complex concepts and maintain a supportive learning environment with consistently high ratings.

### Education
**Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT University), Vellore B-Tech Computer Science (09/2021-07/2025)**
- CGPA: 8.65

### Skills
- **Languages**: C++ | Java | Dart | Python | C | Javascript (Basic)
- **Machine Learning**: Tensorflow | Opencv | LLM | NLP | ML Algorithms (Regression, Classification, Clustering)
- **Cloud and DataBase**: AWS | SQL
- **Frontend and Backend Development**: Flask | HTML | CSS | Firebase

### Projects
**AutoHub** | [GitHub](https://github.com) | Flutter | Dart | Firebase | API
- Developing an auto ride booking system using Flutter for frontend and Firebase for backend. The platform includes two apps, User and Driver, where users set a price for their destination, and drivers bid on it. The user selects the best bid, and the chosen driver is notified.
- Implemented features such as OTP for secure user and driver login, payment integration using Razorpay API, and full ride tracking with Google Maps API.
- Designed and developed the bidding mechanism, allowing drivers to submit bids and users to select the most favorable offer. Incorporated a feedback system for users to rate their ride experience.

**PneumoScan19** | [GitHub](https://github.com) | Video Link | Python | Flask | Tensorflow | HTML
- The project develops an automated tool for detecting COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. It involves collecting and pre-processing X-ray data, training a ResNet-50 model with transfer learning, and deploying the model through a Flask web application.
- The ResNet-50 model, known for its effectiveness in image classification, is used with pre-trained weights from ImageNet. This approach achieved 92.76% accuracy in detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images.
- A Flask-based web application allows users to upload X-ray images for real-time COVID-19 detection. The application processes the images, runs predictions, and displays whether the results are COVID-positive or negative, with built-in error handling for image issues.

**Bus Tracking System** | Video Link | Software Engineering | Tinkercad
- Developed a bus tracking system using Agile and Scrum methodologies with Arduino Uno, Sensors on Tinkercad.
- Applied software engineering concepts like requirement analysis, planning, design, development, and testing.
